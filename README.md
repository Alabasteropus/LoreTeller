# LoreTeller - Immersive Lore Narration for World of Warcraft

> *"Every zone has a story. Now you can hear it."*

## About LoreTeller

LoreTeller is a lore narration addon for World of Warcraft Classic that brings the rich history and stories of Azeroth to life through AI-generated voiceovers. As you explore zones and discover points of interest, you'll hear narrated lore that deepens your understanding of the world around you.

**This addon is a highly modified version of [VoiceOver](https://github.com/mrthinger/wow-voiceover) by mrthinger.** I absolutely loved their addon and the incredible work they did - it inspired me to create something focused specifically on lore narration. I was looking for a more immersive leveling experience and wanted to learn more about the story of Warcraft while playing. LoreTeller is the result of that journey.

## Features

- **Zone Lore Narration** - Hear the history and stories of each zone as you enter
- **Point of Interest Discovery** - Discover lore about specific locations, ruins, and landmarks
- **Quest Voiceovers** - NPCs speak their quest dialogue
- **Gossip Voiceovers** - Hear NPC conversations and greetings
- **Immersive UI** - Clean, unobtrusive interface that enhances rather than distracts

## Current Support

- **World of Warcraft Classic (Vanilla)**
- **Alliance faction** (fully supported)

If people enjoy LoreTeller, I plan to extend support to:
- Horde faction
- The Burning Crusade Classic
